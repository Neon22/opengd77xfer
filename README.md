[![works badge](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/nikku/works-on-my-machine@v0.2.0/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nikku/works-on-my-machine)

## Overview

I use Linux and prefer open-source. OpenGD77 is great, but there is no
proper codeplug-editing solution for Linux. This here tries to do that.

Still very raw, key features missing.

## Roadmap

 Notes to self, what needs to be done:

  * add settings in codeplug (?)
  * implement "import", i.e. modifying a binary from yaml

## Installation

    pip install git+https://github.com/kzyapkov/opengd77xfer.git

should work, then

    gd77xfer -h
    gd77xfer <subcommand> -h
